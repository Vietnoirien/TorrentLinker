# Assistant chat redesign: one chat look on the page and in the panel

Status: proposal, 2026-10-27. Planning only; nothing below is implemented.

The Media Center side chat (`AssistantTab(compact=True)`) already has a header with ☰ / ⋯ / ✕, one composer whose button is Send while idle and Stop while running, and the button roles from `gui/controls.py`. The full Assistant page, on desktop and web, still has the old layout. This plan brings the page onto the same basis. It is workstream D of the [Media Center redesign](media-center-redesign.md) for the Assistant.

## What is wrong today

Seen in `docs/guide/images/assistant.png` and in `AssistantTab.__init__` (`gui/assistant.py`) and `web/static/assistant.js`.

- The mode ("Propositions uniquement") is a bare label above the tabs.
- The discussion list has three full-width text buttons around it: New, Delete, Move to folder.
- The composer row has four controls: a wide model combo, "Discussion settings", "Send" and "Stop".
- Automations and Connections are a plain list over a row of five text buttons.
- Your messages and the assistant's replies use the same card. The "Activity" line weighs as much as a reply.
- A new discussion is an empty transcript with no hint of what to ask.

## Decisions

- **History stays its own tab.**
- **Connections move to Settings → Assistant**, on desktop (`SettingsDialog`) and web. The Assistant page keeps a "Connect a model" call to action that opens that page.
- **Switching to "Run within limits" asks for confirmation the first time only.** The acknowledgement is stored in settings; later switches are immediate.

## Design

### 1. One shared composer

Extract the compact panel's composer into a `ChatComposer` widget (`gui/chat_composer.py`) used by both the page and the Media Center panel. The web gets the matching `chatComposer()` in `assistant.js`.

- A rounded field. The single Send/Stop icon button sits inside it, bottom right, in the primary role.
- Under the field, two chips:
  - **Model chip:** the connection and model name; a click opens the list of connections, plus "Manage connections…" (Settings → Assistant).
  - **Mode chip:** "Proposals" or "Run within limits"; a click toggles it, with the first-time confirmation above.
- Enter sends, Shift+Enter adds a line, Esc in an empty field closes the panel (panel only).
- No model connected: the field is replaced by one primary "Connect a model" button.

### 2. Discussion header

Above the transcript: the title, then ⋯ with Discussion settings, Rename, Move to folder, Delete. In the panel the header keeps its ☰ and ✕.

### 3. Discussion sidebar (page only)

- Top row: a search field that filters by title, and a ＋ icon button for a new discussion.
- The folder tree stays. Each discussion has a context menu (Rename, Move to folder, Delete); folders keep theirs.
- The sidebar width is saved, as in the Media Center (principle 3).
- No full-width buttons.

### 4. Messages

- **Yours:** right-aligned, compact, accent background.
- **The assistant's:** full width, no border, so tables and selection cards have room.
- **Activity:** a quiet single line (▸ 3 tools · finished), expandable as today.
- **Approval cards and questions** keep their bordered card: they are the only elements that ask for a decision.

### 5. Empty state

A new discussion shows four example prompts as clickable cards. A click fills the composer without sending:

- Find ten films I don't seed yet and show them before any action.
- Prepare a Plan within 200 GB with the best Zen gain.
- Review my local upload drafts and list what is missing.
- Play a film with French subtitles.

### 6. Automations and History

- **Automations:** one card per task with its name, schedule, status and next run. The main action ("Run now", or "Enable" when paused) is a secondary button; Edit, Pause and Delete go in ⋯. "Create task" is the page's primary button.
- **History:** unchanged content, restyled with the new message and activity styles.

### 7. Desktop and web

Same structure on both. Web styles go in `app.css` with the existing role classes; desktop uses `set_role` / `icon_button` only, with no page stylesheet setting button looks.

## Acceptance

- The Assistant page and the Media Center panel use the same `ChatComposer`.
- No full-width text buttons on the Assistant page.
- Connections are reachable from Settings → Assistant and from the model chip; the Connections tab is gone.
- The mode chip asks for confirmation on the first switch to "Run within limits" only, and the choice survives a restart.
- Sending, stopping, approving, answering a question, switching and moving discussions, and running a task work as before.
- Tests cover the composer states (idle, running, no model), the first-time confirmation, and the sidebar width persistence.
- Screenshots in French and English, dark and light, at 1280 × 720, on desktop and web, reviewed before publishing.

## Order

1. `ChatComposer` and the message styles, used by both page and panel.
2. Header, sidebar and empty state.
3. Connections moved to Settings, mode chip with first-time confirmation.
4. Automations cards and History restyle.
5. Web parity, screenshots, docs (`docs/guide/*/assistant.md`) and release.
