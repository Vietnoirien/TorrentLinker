"""How fast the app may ask c411: two queues, one per limit c411 applies.

Measured on 2026-10-22 with one key (docs/research/rate-limits.md):

- Searches, Catalogue pages and the profile share a budget of 1,200 requests per
  rolling hour per key, which c411's JSON API reports in `x-ratelimit-*` headers; its
  guide also documents 120 requests a minute.
- .torrent downloads do not count in that budget. They have their own limit, which
  c411 does not report; past it, it answers 429 for a while.

So a Library search never waits behind a Plan's downloads, and goes as fast as c411
allows while the budget lasts.
