"""Reseed: add a Match to qBittorrent against the existing data, then verify it.

The torrent is added stopped, checked, and only
started once Verification shows every piece is already there. A Match with absent
files is left stopped after Verification, because starting it would fetch the pieces
it shares with local files. A failed Verification removes the torrent (never its data)
and records a Rejection. µTorrent may rename files on disk after explicit approval,
with a recovery journal; other clients leave names untouched. See ADR-0002/0013.
